Number of global variables and their usage: 14 global variables
p - Pointer to the current position in the source code, used for reading characters.
lp - Pointer to the last processed line in the source code, useful for handling line breaks.
data - Pointer used to manage the data section of the program.
e - Pointer to the current position in emitted code, used during code generation.
le - Pointer to the last emitted instruction, mainly for debugging and printing.
id - Pointer to the currently parsed identifier in the symbol table.
sym - Pointer to the symbol table, storing variables, functions, and keywords.
tk - Stores the current token type being processed by the lexical analyzer.
ival - Holds the numeric value of a token when dealing with literals.
ty - Tracks the type of the current expression.
loc - Stores the local variable offset, used in function stack management.
line - Keeps track of the current line number for error reporting and debugging.
src - A flag that enables the printing of source and assembly code during execution.
